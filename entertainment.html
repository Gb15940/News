                Youtubers have always been a topic that's been passed over,
                mostly because they're just sitting on this one platform and not expanding from gaming or reaction videos.
                However, that has changed drastically.

                but has expanded into his own business, <a href=https://topofthemornincoffee.com/">Top Of The Mornin Coffee</a>,

            Markiplier, Mark Fischbach, is another youtuber of around the same subscriber count, and possibly even the same affect on people like Sean.
            <br>He has also expanded his career far beyond just being a youtuber, while also having made a few other channels during his time.
            <br>Mark has made podcasts, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2X40qLyoj1wQ2qE5FVpA7x">Distractible</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3NJbt2dlKfrL7VbWbrw2jq">The Edge of Sleep</a> 
            that later turned into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGxCmkPjCNk&ab_channel=Markiplier">tv series</a> on amazon.
            He has now also made his own movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8E8Ryx49so&ab_channel=Markiplier">Iron Lung</a>, 
            which was based on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPiCSsW-2as&ab_channel=Markiplier">indie horror game</a> he had played about a year earlier,
            and owns his own joint clothing company with Jacksepticeye, called <a href="https://cloakbrand.com/">CLOAK</a>.
