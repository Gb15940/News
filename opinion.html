                Five Nights at Freddys, one of the internets best indie horror games, is still trending even after 10 whole years.
                It has about nineteen games, with around eleven of them are actually from the main series.
                <br>Though there has been backlash or controversial topics regarding this indie horror game franchise,
                The fandom and community are still strong with creativity and specifically, fangames.
                <br>With the movies being in production and one already being released, fans have made variations
                of the movie and more recreations of both their own past horror games, and the originals from the series.
                This really shows just how much games can influence creativity in peoples lives, and make everything better.
                <br>The series should seriously continue, as long as it's not just for money and success.
                <br>(I felt so cringe writing that, 
                but seriously, 
                the fangames and fandom in general have made my life just a bit more bareable. ^^
                and plus, it boosted so many careers like on youtube.)

            Infinity train, one of HBO Max's (Now just Max) best series was cancelled years ago.
            <br>Many people, including various youtubers and myself, think it should have continued.
            The series sadly ended due to some undisclosed reasons with no official explanation,
            and many people made videos about it. This includes

            One of the most favorited horror indie games this year, was the $13 dollar game called Mouthwashing.
            <br>
            <br>There may contain spoilers ahead, be warned.
            <br>
            <br>The game follows the two protagonists, Curly and Jimmy. Switching between those two throughout the game,
            you learn what had happened to the past crew-mates and what you did that made everything go wrong.
            With the confusing way that the story is placed together, plus the psychological horror elements mixed in,
            the internet loved this game and made it's own amazing community filled with 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x554c_dVmw&ab_channel=MadsSherrick">artists</a> 
            and tons of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/mouthwash">creativity</a>.
            <br>Though it has such a sweet environment around it with the fandom, 
            the game is actually about nonconsentual actions and mistakes
            that were made, and how the protagonist, Jimmy, who you play as, needs to take responsibility.
            <br>Take responsibility.
            <br>Take responsibility.
            <br>Take responsibility.
