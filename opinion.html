            Infinity train, one of HBO Max's (Now just Max) best series was cancelled years ago.
            <br>Many people, including various youtubers and myself, think it should have continued.
            The series sadly ended due to some undisclosed reasons with no official explanation,
            and many people made videos about it. This includes

            One of the most favorited horror indie games this year, was the $13 dollar game called Mouthwashing.
            <br>
            <br>There may contain spoilers ahead, be warned.
            <br>
            <br>The game follows the two protagonists, Curly and Jimmy. Switching between those two throughout the game,
            you learn what had happened to the past crew-mates and what you did that made everything go wrong.
            With the confusing way that the story is placed together, plus the psychological horror elements mixed in,
            the internet loved this game and made it's own amazing community filled with artists and
            tons of creativity.
            <br>Though it has such a sweet environment around it with the fandom, 
            the game is actually about nonconsentual actions and mistakes
            that were made, and how the protagonist, Jimmy, who you play as, needs to take responsibility.
            <br>Take responsibility.
            <br>Take responsibility.
            <br>Take responsibility.
