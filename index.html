<!--
For this project, you will be creating the ultimate clickbait and fake news media organization! In style.

1) Create a name for your organization.

2) Design your webpage on paper, making sure to write out which semantic tags you will use. 

3) You will need to refresh yourselves on CSS VariablesLinks to an external site.

4) You will use Adobe Color Links to an external site.to define a color palette (which I spelled wrong on the whiteboard I think) that you will use, through variables, on your site.

The site MUST have headers, footers, articles, navigation, figures, sections, and asides. You may of course also use divs and spans in addition to the semantic tags.  

You will have 4 pages -
A homepage, where you will advertise your top article(s) and have the ability to navigate to the other pages,

Pick three of the following: 
An "Opinion" page that contains at least two articles that are the 'opinions' of made-up columnists.
A "Business" page that contains at least two articles about stocks and/or businesses that can be real or completely fabricated.
An "Entertainment" page that contains at least two articles about either real or fake celebrities/movies etc.
If there is another type of page you can think of that you want to do, just ask.

You must have navigation between all of the pages, using the <nav> tag. 
All pages must have a header (<nav> should be in here) this can also contain a logo (find one online or make one in paint/photoshop if you like)

The footer for your pages should be comprised of:
A contact section
A copyright section
